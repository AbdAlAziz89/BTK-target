# BTK-target
This project contains a Python script (pca_scoring.py) designed for the fast initial scoring of billions of compounds based on known active physicochemical properties using PCA (Principal Component Analysis) scoring. The script leverages various libraries to compute molecular properties, perform PCA, and evaluate new compounds against known actives.

Requirements
To run this script, you will need the following Python libraries:

pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, scikit-learn, rdkit
